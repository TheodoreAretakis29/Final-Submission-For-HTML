	<h1>Starting an HTML document</h1>
	<div>
		<!-- What you will be reading in these next paragraphs briefly sum up the Codecademy course for HTML -->
		<p>You are able to let browsers be aware of the fact that you are using HTML by starting up a Document Type Declaration. The docuemnt type declaration must always be the first line of code in an HTML docuemnt. Even if its forgotten, the HTML document will still work though it's risky After the Document Type Declaration add opening and closing HTML tags.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<!-- It's important to always but titles, and include opening and closing tags when needed! -->
		<h2>A Bit of Preparation (Body, Title)</h2>
		<p>You can add titles to your web page using the title element. Before we can add content, opening and closing body tags must be on screen. Once the file has a body, it can have different sort of things, like images, text, and buttons, which can be added to the body. "Self-closing elements" hold all the things that an internet browser will need to render an element inside of a single tag.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<!-- Line breaks let you cleanly put text to the next line, whenever you need to, it's rather cool -->
		<h2>Some formatting (Break Element, and P Element)</h2>
		<p>The line break element breaks up a line and will push all of the text to the next, so that text can look cleaner, depending on what you're doing. When an element is contained inside another element, it is considered the child of that element, and that one would play the role of a parent. HTML documents are a collection of parent and child document. The P element is the child to the Body element and is used to hold what is to be considered as normal text. Whitespace and indentation are two systems that programmers use to keep track of their of how elements are related, in their documents. The two of them use the independant position of elements to whitespace and indentation within an HTML file.</p>

		<!-- As Imention below, this is what a comment is -->
		<h2>Different Attributes and Elements (Part 1)</h2>
		<p>In HTML, comments can also be written, like in Lua, though they're formatted differently. In HTML, there are heading elements (hi,h2, h3, h4, h5, h6). In total, there are 6 of them and they have various functions such as giving titles to articles and pages. is used to hold a piece of normal text. The div element is used to divide HTML documents into multile sections. The em and strong exist so that they can describe and organize the content that appears on your pages. Unordered list tag create a list items in a randomized list with bullet points. individual items must be listed using li. the ul tag cannot hold raw text so that is why we need the li. ol are unordered lists and instead of bullet points, there are numbers.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<!-- Images and videos add something cool and different to the page, spicing things up -->
		<h2>Different Attributes and Elements (part 2)</h2>
		<h5>THIS SECTION WILL MAINLY FOCUS ON LINKING IMAGES AND WEBSITES TO YOUR HTML DOCUMENT</h5>
		<p>The img tag allows you to add an image to a web page. The alt attritbute is solely used with the <img> element. It's value should be describing an image. It helps with the visually impaired attribute. The video tag lets you add videos to the page and is very similar to the img tag. As a project grows in size, people may want to include extra folders within their main folders. about.html, contact.html, and index.html are all different types of files. If the files index.html is being displayed, then the other two will know that it's been open since their all in the same folder. Nav link is used to wrap links and organize them.</p>
